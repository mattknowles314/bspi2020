# Notable Genes From VULCAN Results

- RESPONDER VS NON-RESPONDER
1. BIRC2, p=0.0024
    -> This gene encodes a protein which inhinits apoptosis

- RESPONDER VS METASTASIS
1. BAIAP2, p=0.00253
    -> Protein encoded by this gene is a brain-speicif angiogenesis inhibitor
2. ZNF592, p=0.00258
    -> Believed to play a roe in a complex developmental pathway and the regulation of genes involved in cerebellar development.
3. BASP1, p=0.00386
    -> iThis gene is responsible for encoding a protein with several transient phosphoylation sites and PEST motifs. 

- NONRESPONDER VS METASTASIS
1. DAP3, p=0.00207
    -> Plays key roles in translation, cellular respiration, and apoptosis. This gene is known to be associated with cancer development, although it is shown to aid some but supress others.
2. HUS1, p=0.00339
    -> The protein encoded by HUS1 is involved in the cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage.
3. CTCF, p=
    -> Codes a transcription factor. 
4. DVL3, p=0.00337
    -> Encodes a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein that regulates cell proliferation
